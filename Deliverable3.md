# Overview of the School District Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate the students_complete.csv file because it showed evidence of academic dishonesty at Thomas High School with a focus on 9th grade reading and math grades. While keeping the data intact we were asked to replace the math and reading scores with NaNs which is a way to represent the missing value in data and stands for “Not A Number.” After replacing the scores with NaNs, we repeated the school district analysis by recreating the following criteria:
•	The district summary

•	The school summary

•	The top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate

•	The average math score for each grade level from each school

•	The average reading score for each grade level from each school

•	The scores by school spending per student, by school size, and by school type 

# Results

## How is the district summary affected?

The data was adjusted to use NaNs which recalculated the percentages for the passing of math, reading and overall. Since the count of students were not adjusted to NaNs, it did not change the total count of students. The change was less than 1% from the original analysis and the challenge analysis, both would round to the same nearest whole number.

# Summary
The four major changes I noticed in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs were 
1. Overall Passing Rate changed from 91% to 65% for Thomas High School, which is an extreme difference of 26%. 
2. In the district of 15 campuses, Thomas High School's ranking dropped from 2nd to 8th, a difference of 6 rankings. 
3. The Campuses math and reach averages and passing percentages all had shifts in their rates. 
4. For the 9th grade students at Thomas High School the grade level data will now show "NaN" in reports.
